HELP_MESSAGE="This utility allows you to switch CPU energy performance preference.
\n\n
It interacts with the files located in the directories /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy\*
\n\n\n
The following usages are available:
\n\n
$0 help - display this help message and exit
\n\n
$0 list - get available performance preferences (print the energy_performance_available_preferences file of policy0)
\n\n
$0 get_current - get currently selected performance preferences of all policies (contents of the
energy_performance_preference files)
\n\n
$0 get - synonym of get_current
\n\n
$0 set <performance_mode> - write <performance_mode> to the energy_performance_preference files of all policies
\n\n
$0 extreme - (extreme powersave mode) force constant lowest possible frequency: set frequency upper limit to the
lowest value alowed by hardware (copy contents of cpuinfo_min_freq to file scaling_max_freq for each policy)
\n\n
$0 unextreme - reset frequency upper limit (back?) to the highest value allowed by hardware (copy contents of
cpuinfo_max_freq to file scaling_max_freq for each policy)
